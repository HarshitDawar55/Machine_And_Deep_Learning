    "* It stands for Density Based Spatial clustering of applications with Noise.\n",
    "* It works based on density of points in a particular radius.\n",
    "* It is one of the most commonly used algorithms.\n",
    "* It has 2 parameters on which it works:\n",
    "  * Radius: It is the radius of the neirhborhood, if it includes enough points then it is known as Dense Area.\n",
    "  * Minimum number of neighbors: These are the min. no. of points that should be present in the radius to define a cluster."
